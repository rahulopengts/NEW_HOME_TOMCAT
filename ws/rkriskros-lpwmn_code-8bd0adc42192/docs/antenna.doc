The antenna is a very important component of communication systems. By definition, an antenna is a 
device used to transform an RF signal, travelling on a conductor, into an electromagnetic wave in 
free space (transmit mode), and to transform an RF electromagnetic wave into an electrical signal 
(receive mode).  The choice of antenna is very important for a transmitting - receiving communication 
system. The antenna must be able to radiate or receive efficiently so the power supplied is not wasted.


Solid angle
-----------
In geometry, a solid angle (symbol: Ω) is the two-dimensional angle in three-dimensional space that an object 
subtends at a point. The solid angle (in sr) of a sphere measured from its center is 4*PI sr 

   Ω = (4*PI*r*r / (r*r)) = 4*PI


Radiation Power density (Pd)
----------------------------
The power of a transmitter that is radiated from an isotropic antenna will have a uniform power density (power 
per unit area) in all directions. The power density at any distance from an isotropic antenna is simply the 
transmitter power divided by the surface area of a sphere (4BR ) at that distance. The surface area of the
sphere increases by the square of the radius, therefore the power density, Pd, (watts/square meter) decreases 
by the square D of the radius.

   Pd = Pt / (4*PI*r*r)


Radiation Power intensity (Pins)
--------------------------------
Radiation intensity (Pins) in a given direction, instead, is defined as the power radiated from an antenna per 
unit solid angle. 

For an isotropic antenna -

   Pins = Pt / (4*PI)

The radiation intensity is a far field parameter, and can be obtained multiplying the radiation density by the 
square of the distance.

   Pins = Pd * r * r


Directivity
-----------
Directivity of an antenna is defined as the ratio of the radiation intensity in a given direction from the antenna 
to the radiation intensity averaged over all directions. The average radiation intensity is equal to the total power 
radiated by the antenna divided by 4*PI. If the direction is not specified, the direction of maximum radiation 
intensity is implied. For an isotropic source, it is very obvious that the directivity is unity since its power is 
radiated equally well in all directions. For all other sources, the maximum directivity is always greater than unity. 
It is a relative “figure of merit” which gives an indication of the directional properties of the antenna as compared 
with those of an isotropic source.

Antenna polarization is a very important consideration when choosing and installing an antenna. Most 
communications systems use either vertical, horizontal or circular polarization. Knowing the difference 
between polarizations and how to maximize their benefit is very important to the antenna user.

A Polarization Review
An antenna is a transducer that converts radio frequency electric current to electromagnetic waves that are 
then radiated into space. The electric field or "E" plane determines the polarization or orientation of the 
radio wave. In general, most antennas radiate either linear or circular polarization.

A linear polarized antenna radiates wholly in one plane containing the direction of propagation. In a circular 
polarized antenna, the plane of polarization rotates in a circle making one complete revolution during one period 
of the wave. If the rotation is clockwise looking in the direction of propagation, the sense is called right-hand-
circular (RHC). If the rotation is counterclockwise, the sense is called left-hand-circular (LHC).

An antenna is said to be vertically polarized (linear) when its electric field is perpendicular to the Earth's 
surface. An example of a vertical antenna is a broadcast tower for AM radio or the "whip" antenna on an automobile.

Horizontally polarized (linear) antennas have their electric field parallel to the Earth's surface. Television 
transmissions in the USA use horizontal polarization.

A circular polarized wave radiates energy in both the horizontal and vertical planes and all planes in between. 
The difference, if any, between the maximum and the minimum peaks as the antenna is rotated through all angles, is 
called the axial ratio or ellipticity and is usually specified in decibels (dB). If the axial ratio is near 0 dB, 
the antenna is said to be circular polarized. If the axial ratio is greater than 1-2 dB, the polarization is often 
referred to as elliptical.


Polarization is an important design consideration. The polarization of each antenna in a system should be 
properly aligned. Maximum signal strength between stations occurs when both stations are using identical 
polarization.

When choosing an antenna, it is an important consideration as to whether the polarization is linear or 
elliptical. If the polarization is linear, is it vertical or horizontal? If circular, is it RHC or LHC?


On line-of-sight (LOS) paths, it is most important that the polarization of the antennas at both ends of 
the path use the same polarization. In a linearly polarized system, a misalignment of polarization of 45 
degrees will degrade the signal up to 3 dB and if misaligned 90 degrees the attenuation can be 20 dB or 
more. Likewise, in a circular polarized system, both antennas must have the same sense. If not, an additional 
loss of 20 dB or more will be incurred.

Also note that linearly polarized antennas will work with circularly polarized antennas and vice versa. However, 
there will be up to a 3 dB loss in signal strength. In weak signal situations, this loss of signal may impair 
communications.

Cross polarization is another consideration. It happens when unwanted radiation is present from a polarization 
which is different from the polarization in which the antenna was intended to radiate. For example, a vertical 
antenna may radiate some horizontal polarization and vice versa. However, this is seldom a problem unless there 
is noise or strong signals nearby.

Typical Applications
Vertical polarization is most often used when it is desired to radiate a radio signal in all directions such 
as widely distributed mobile units. Vertical polarization also works well in the suburbs or out in the country, 
especially where hills are present. As a result, nowadays most two-way Earth to Earth communications in the 
frequency range above 30 MHz use vertical polarization.
