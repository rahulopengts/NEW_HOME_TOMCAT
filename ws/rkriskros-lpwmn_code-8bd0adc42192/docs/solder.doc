Flux-core solder

Electrical solder with an integrated rosin core, visible as a dark spot in the cut end of the solder wire.
Main article: Flux (metallurgy)
Flux is a reducing agent designed to help reduce (return oxidized metals to their metallic state) metal 
oxides at the points of contact to improve the electrical connection and mechanical strength. The two 
principal types of flux are acid flux, used for metal mending and plumbing, and rosin flux, used in 
electronics, where the corrosiveness of acid flux and vapors released when solder is heated would risk 
damaging delicate circuitry.
Due to concerns over atmospheric pollution and hazardous waste disposal, the electronics industry has been 
gradually shifting from rosin flux to water-soluble flux, which can be removed with deionized water and 
detergent, instead of hydrocarbon solvents.
In contrast to using traditional bars or coiled wires of all-metal solder and manually applying flux to 
the parts being joined, much hand soldering since the mid-20th century has used flux-core solder. This is 
manufactured as a coiled wire of solder, with one or more continuous bodies of non-acid flux embedded 
length wise inside it. As the solder melts onto the joint, it frees the flux and releases that on it as well.

Flux

Now, there is more to soldering than just the solder and the metal you wish to join. There is also flux. 
Flux is a material that is applied to the metal to transfer the heat of the iron to the metal so that the 
solder will actually chemically bond with it. It is a catalyst in the reaction, so to say.

I'm sure many of you have not heard of flux or have used solder without flux and have had good joints. In 
reality, you are using flux without knowing it! A lot of the hobby and electronic solders are called "core 
solders". This means that in the solder is a core of rosin and flux! The rosin is there to keep the solder's 
integrity until it is melted.

There are also "solid solders" that do not have a core of flux so that flux must be externally applied to 
the metal joint.

There is another type of core solder you may encounter called "acid core". This is a lot like the rosin core 
except that the flux contains a certain acid. This type of solder/flux is used to bond metals that need a 
"little more encouragement" to bond.

The problem with the core solders with the flux inside is that if heat is left too long on the joint, the 
flux will burn off, and the solder will no longer flow or bond to the metal. This causes having to apply 
more solder which can cause it to just "lump" on the joint instead of flowing over the joint. It is much 
more effective to use solid solder and apply the flux to the joint. The solder will flow and bond much 
better!

If you use an external flux that you must apply yourself, make sure that it is lead free too.  Check the 
package.


"http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/14-6337-0062/KE1603-ND/265623" is a solid wire solder.

Important points about this product -

> Industry standard RMA cored wire

> Kester 285 consists of high quality, purified rosin to which a synergistic combination of
activating agents has been incorporated. The fluxing ability of 285 is much greater than ordinary
mildly activated rosin fluxes and is comparable to fully activated rosin fluxes. Kester 285 has been
developed for use in the electronic industry where difficult assemblies are to be soldered, but process
requirements stipulate use of a mildly activated rosin flux. 

> Cleaning: Kester 285 flux residues are non-corrosive, non-conductive and do not require removal 
            in most applications. 

> Process Considerations:
Process Considerations:
Solder iron tip temperatures are most commonly between 315-371°C (600-700°F) for Sn63Pb37. 
  - Heat both the land area and component lead to be soldered with the iron prior to adding 
    Kester 285 cored wire. 
  - Apply the solder wire to the land area or component lead. 
  - Do not apply the wire directly to the soldering iron tip.
