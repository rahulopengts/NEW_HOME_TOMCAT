>>> CC1101 AGC
The main purpose of the AGC module is to adjust the gain of the analogue LNAs and the 
digital VGA, so that the IF-ADC and DVGA are not saturated and the demodulator is able to 
perform demodulation. The module also reports the received signal level (RSSI), and 
indicates if a carrier is present (carrier sense). 
The AGC module is basically part of a control loop, which aims to keep the in-band signal 
level in the demodulator constant, regardless of the signal level at the antenna. The AGC 
module low-pass filters the magnitude signal and compares the value to a programmable 
target magnitude (AGCCTRL2.MAGN_TARGET). The new gain setting is calculated by adding 
the deviation from the target magnitude to the previous gain setting. 


>>> CC1101 RSSI
17.3 RSSI
The RSSI value is an estimate of the signal power level in the chosen channel. This value 
is based on the current gain setting in the RX chain and the measured signal level in the 
channel.

>>> CS (in our implementation)
CS is asserted when the RSSI is above a programmable absolute threshold, and deasserted when 
RSSI is below the same threshold (with hysteresis).

17.4.1 CS Absolute Threshold
The absolute threshold related to the RSSI value depends on the following register fields:
> AGCCTRL2.MAX_LNA_GAIN
> AGCCTRL2.MAX_DVGA_GAIN
> AGCCTRL1.CARRIER_SENSE_ABS_THR
> AGCCTRL2.MAGN_TARGET

For given AGCCTRL2.MAX_LNA_GAIN and AGCCTRL2.MAX_DVGA_GAIN settings, the absolute threshold 
can be adjusted ±7 dB in steps of 1 dB using CARRIER_SENSE_ABS_THR.

-------------------------------------------------------
CARRIER_SENSE_ABS_THR[3:0] setting
Sets the absolute RSSI threshold for asserting carrier sense. The 2-complement signed 
threshold is programmed in steps of 1 dB and is relative to the MAGN_TARGET setting.

>>> Crystal terminology
Crystal tolerance (in ppm)
The Frequency Tolerance of a crystal or oscillator is defined as the initial deviation of the 
crystal or oscillator frequency as compared to the absolute at 25°C. 

Crystal stability (in ppm)
The Frequency Stability over temp is defined as the frequency deviation compared to the measured 
frequency at 25°C OVER the defined operating temperature range (I.E. 0°C to +70°C).  

Crystal temperature range
What happens when the crystal is not operating within the temperature range stated in the spec ? 
The crystal performance will be adversely affected. It can cause the frequency of the crystal to 
drift. In the worst-case scenario it may cause a malfunction of the designer’s circuit or, at best, 
unpredictable performance.

Crystal oscillator start-up time depends on crystal ESR and load capacitances. 

>>> Importance of choosing the right capacitors for a crystal
if you want to get accurate and stable results out of the crystal, you need to match the capacitors 
to the specific crystal you chose, and it varies from model to model even with the same manufacturer.   
If you buy a stable crystal (more expensive) but you don’t use the right capacitors along with the 
crystal your signal will never be anything remotely close to the tolerance specified in the datasheet 
and you may as well buy a much cheaper crystal.

>>> CC1101 frequency synthesis
A phase locked loop (PLL) is used to generate the RF frequency in the CC1100/CC1101/CC1100E 
transceiver and CC1110/CC1111/CC430 SoC. The PLL reference frequency is derived from an 
external crystal. If the crystal frequency is incorrect, the transmitter carrier frequency 
and the receiver LO frequency will also be incorrect. The crystal frequency error is due to 
initial tolerance, capacitive loading errors, ageing, and temperature drift.

Example: If the crystal frequency has an error of +/- X ppm (parts per million) the RF frequency 
also has an error of +/- X ppm. As an example, if the crystal error is +10 ppm and the CC11xx is 
programmed for a carrier frequency of 868 MHz, there will be an error in the carrier frequency 
of 868 MHz*10/1E6
 = 8.68 kHz. 


>>> Carson's rule
If frequency modulation is used (FSK or GFSK) Carson's bandwidth rule can be applied to define 
the approximate bandwidth requirements.
The transmitted signal will have a certain signal bandwidth (signal_BW), which depends on the 
data rate and modulation format. This bandwidth can be approximated by Carson's rule:

signal_BW = 2*fm + 2*fdev (= (data rate + frequency separation))

where

- fm is the highest modulating frequency. 2*fm = data rate
- fdev is the frequency deviation. 2*fdev = frequency separation

signal_BW for 4.8 kbps and +/-25.4 kHz deviation is then approximated as 55.2 kHz
signal_BW for 10 kbps and +/-19 kHz deviation is then approximated as 48 kHz


Example >>>
If both the transmitter and receiver crystal accuracy is ±10 ppm and the CC11xx is 
programmed for a carrier frequency of 868 MHz with an IF frequency of 300 kHz, BWchannel
must be larger than BWsignal + 4· XTALppm· fRF = BWsignal + 4*10*868 Hz 

>>> Rx filter bandwidth
Required RX filter bandwidth can be approximated as -
(Signal BW) + 4x(ppm xtal)x(Frequency of operation)
where Signal_BW  = Data rate + 2 x frequency deviation.

The default values give 203 kHz channel filter bandwidth, assuming a 26.0 MHz crystal.
The default values give a data rate of 115.051 kBaud (closest setting to 115.2 kBaud), assuming 
a 26.0 MHz crystal.
The default values give ±47.607 kHz deviation assuming 26.0 MHz crystal frequency.

Assume cystal tolerance is +/- 10 ppm

RX filter bw = 115051 + 2x47607 + 4 x 10x10^-6 x 868x10^6 = 244985

>>> Reducing channel usage by using GFSK

In ‘true’ 2-FSK systems with abrupt frequency shifting, the spectrum is inherently broad. By 
making the frequency shift ‘softer’, the spectrum can be made significantly narrower. Thus, 
higher data rates can be transmitted in the same bandwidth using GFSK.


>>>
Channel filtering and frequency offset compensation is performed digitally.

On the receiver side there is a channel filter, which is centered on the down-converted 
received RF frequency, i.e. the intermediate frequency (IF). The channel filter has a 
programmable bandwidth BWchannel. The signal bandwidth has to be less than the receiver 
channel filter bandwidth, but we also have to take the frequency error of the transmitter 
and receiver into account.

If there is an error in the transmitter carrier frequency and the receiver LO frequency, 
there will also be an error in the IF frequency. For simplicity assume the frequency error 
in the transmitter and receiver is equal (same type of crystal). If the receiver has an 
error of –X ppm and the transmitter has an error of +X ppm the IF frequency will have an 
error of +2*X ppm (CC11xx uses low side LO injection). Conversely, if the receiver has an 
error of +X ppm and the transmitter an error of -X ppm the IF frequency will have an error 
of -2*X ppm.

BWchannel has to be larger than the maximum signal bandwidth BWsignal plus the maximum 
frequency error due to crystal inaccuracies. Worst case scenario will be for the crystal 
errors on Tx and RX side to be of opposite signs

BWchannel > BWsignal + 4* XTALppm* fRF

where

- XTALppm is the total accuracy of the crystal including initial tolerance, temperature drift, 
  loading, and ageing

- fRF is the RF operating frequency.





>> Q: FAQ: Reducing number of false packet detections in CC110x/CC111x/CC2500/CC251x RX mode

The CC110x/CC111x/CC2500/CC251x can inherently trigger packet detection upon noise. The reason 
is that the internal receiver chain will, by design, continuously demodulate any signal picked 
up on the antenna, even though there is no "real" active transmitter on the air. The possible 
methods for reducing number of false packet detections are:

* Enable Carrier Sense (CS) dependent SYNC trigging, by setting [MDMCFG2.SYNC_MODE > 4].
  This means that a certain RSSI strength (threshold programmable via AGCCTRL1/2) must be present
  before allowing SYNC detection.

* Increase the Preamble Quality Threshold (PKTCTRL1.PQT) to demand a more persistent PREAMBLE pattern
  before allowing SYNC detection.

* Extend the required SYNC pattern.
  This can be done by increasing the number of SYNC bytes (MDMCFG1.SYNC_MODE).

* Use address filtering (PKTCTRL1.ADR_CHK > 0).

Summary -

It is important to note that the radio must stay in RX for a little while before the
RSSI is valid (if STX is strobed before the RSSI is valid, the packet will not be
sent). DN505 explains how the RSSI Response time (the time it takes before the
RSSI is valid) can be estimated. Have in mind that this estimation will only be
valid for weak signals. For stronger signals, the RSSI response time will be longer
and the application should add some margins. To avoid too much overhead when
waiting fro the RSSI to be valid, there is an indirect method of checking if the RSSI
is valid.

Assume a data rate is 10 kBaud (CC2500). From DN505 one can see that for weak
signals, the RSSI response time is ~250 us. Testing has showed that for stronger
signals (- 50 dBm), the response time is ~380 us. When adding some margins one
should wait for example 500 us after RX mode is entered BEFORE trying  to strobe
STX.

A transmit using CCA can then be implemented as follows:

1) Strobe SRX
2) Wait for RX mode to be entered (poll MARCSTATE)
3) Wait 500 us for RSSI to be valid (in this wait function one can check to see if
    CS or CCA is being asserted. If they are, one can break from this function as it
    is not necessary to wait any longer)
4) Strobe STX
5) Check that the packet is being sent.

    This can be done in 3 different ways:
    a) Poll MARCSTATE to see if the radio enters TX state
    b) Wait for the packet sent signal (IOCFGn=0x06) to be asserted. Since this
        signal also can indicate that a packet has been received (if the channel was
        not clear and the radio continued in RX state), one should now read the
        TXBYTE status register to check if the packet is still in the TXFIFO.
    c) Wait for a PA_PD signal (IOCFGn=0x1B) to be asserted. This should happen
        about 782/fRef us after the STX strobe has been issued (fRef is the
        reference frequency for the synthesizer in MHz)

Difference between CC1101 and CC1200


1>>>>>
CC1120 has far better blocking performance that CC1101. For CC1120+CC1190 it is possible to reach up to 27dBm 
output power and better sensitivity than a CC1101 based design.

For which frequency band are you developing for? Which interferer frequencies are a problem with the existing 
design? Does the CC1101+CC1190 contain a SAW filter? 

If a SAW filter is used in the existing design the SAW filter will attenuate signals outside the passband with 
>50dB dependent on the filter and the frequency offset. This makes a difference if the interferer frequencies 
are some MHz away and you compare CC1101+CC1190 with SAW filter against CC1120.


2>>>>>
CC1101 FIFOs are 64 bytes each (RX and TX) where as CC1200 FIFOs are 128 bytes each.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



What is the maximum range can CC1101 give. I need a tranceiver which give me 1km - 3 km distance

You can achieve a range of several km with the CC1101 without any problems (line of sight). The output power 
can be programmed up to 12dBm and the sensitivity level on the receiver is dependent on the programmed baud
rate. With a sensitivity of -112dBm and an output power of 12dBm, 915MHz ; the expected range with Friis 
equation adapted to take into account the height from the ground would be approx 3km.


The distance of 3km (LOS) is practical but if this has to be guaranteed then the environment parameters will 
have to be reviewed thoroughly. Totally agree that the antenna choice and height above ground has a huge part 
to determine the overall distance. Also, any objects that  are in the LOS between the Rx and Tx unit will have 
to be compensated for the link budget. Calculating an accurate expected range is very difficult (near impossible) 
and every application has it's own parameters that have to be taken into account. No one can ever guarantee a 
specific range with a chipset because of these application specific parameters. Only a rough range guideline can 
be given.

In order to make a practical link of 3km, then the worst case scenerios must be reviewed and taken into account 
when calculating the link budget. The maximum output that is possible is limited to the regulation requirements. 
At 915 MHz, FCC 15.247 states that the maximum carrier power should not exceed 30dBm and for FCC 15.249, 0dBm 
should not be exceeded.  

A more practical approach would be to obtain the development kits and to test the units in the application 
environments that you are considering. What's nice with smart RF studio is that the radio parameters can easily 
be configured and then tested.

This range thing really had me going nuts a while back until I put some other information to the question. The 
question that needs to be asked is: what distance can I get with some specific error rate, and data rate? Also 
given that PSK is being used one needs a finite signal to noise gain in order to assue that error rate. The real 
noise floor happens to be the noise floor in your area along with your height and line of site limitations. It is 
very easy to lop off 30db+ of theoretical margin to get a practical link when one considers this and adds for 
fade and multipath. Once these adders are included realistic ranges begin to come from the equations. And data
rate plays a part in that margin as well.

It would be great to se a paper with all of these things taken into account and show the revised theoretical and 
the actual results.

With the standard kit antenna (W5017 from Pulse) supplied with the CC1101 EMs, settings of 0dBm output power, 
250kbps, 1.3m above GND; a range of 250m has been achieved. Yes, this was a pure LOS range test. Very difficult 
to determine indoor range since the indoor attenuators vary from a couple of dBs to many 10s of dBs.

The ground reflection has quite big effect on the RF performance. The short range you got might be due to your 
placing the modules quite near the ground. 

Manually holding the board could de-tune the antenna some. If you look at http://www.ti.com/lit/an/swra338/swra338.pdf 
the report say that the efficiency is 25%. In the equation you have to adjust the Transmit output power accordingly 
to the real output power from the antenna. The range will also be affected by in which angle the antenna is placed in.

If a trace is about 1/10 of a wavelength or shorter it will not act as a transmission line and hence the width of the 
trace is of less importance. But you need Z132 and Z133 in your design since this tune the antenna to 50ohm. If you 
don't have these components in your design the antenna will have fairly poor performance.
